## 📌 Project Title: CollabCanva - Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard Application

### 🔍 Overview

As part of my internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**, I developed **CollabCanva**, a **Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard Application** that allows multiple users to draw and interact simultaneously on a shared canvas through a web browser. This project was built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Socket.IO, and WebRTC**, aligning with the MERN stack principles where real-time communication and interactivity were key goals.

## 📖 Project Description

The goal of this project was to create an online whiteboard that enables **real-time collaboration**. Users can draw simultaneously, and their drawings are instantly broadcast to all connected peers using **Socket.IO**. Each user's session includes customizable brush tools and the ability to erase or clear the canvas.

For added interactivity, the app also supports **video calling** through **WebRTC**, enabling seamless communication between users without external plugins. Signaling is handled over Socket.IO to establish direct peer-to-peer connections.

This project demonstrates key MERN stack principles, particularly the backend part (Node.js + Express) and real-time features.

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is hosted live using **Render**, making it accessible securely through HTTPS with no installation required.
